Bugs & Shortcomings
-------------------

- Support UNH, UNT etc. or give warning message about unparsed data elements
- display message spec with groups (currently only linear list with only 
  top-level (trigger) segments)

Features
--------

- Codes list browseable/searchable
- Show codes with simple data element
- Expose additional spec info (notes, full description)
- File upload of spec
- REST API for validating messages?
- edify: give list of available (downloaded/extracted) spec versions
- Spec search: fill combo box with available versions (default: most reccent)
- structured output of parsed message (Dynatree?)
- Display of (original?) message with tooltips containing spec information?
- Rendering of messages with template
  - future (maybe): template as form, to allow creation of message
- store uploaded messages in DB?
- import EDIFACT messags from OpenData source?
- User account?
- Ansible scripts for public server
- Parallel search for specs? (Check if this could really be faster)
